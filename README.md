```

This is the recommended way to install psst as it provides better version management and isolation.

## Usage

### Interactive Console

Open the interactive console to manage your secrets:

```bash
psst
```

### Run Commands with Secrets

Run any command with your secrets injected into its environment:

```bash
psst <any command>
```

### Examples

```bash
# Open a shell with secrets
psst zsh

# Run a development server
psst npm run dev

# View injected secrets
psst env

# Use secrets in a shell command
psst sh -c 'echo $A_SECRET'
```

## Configuration

psst looks for a config file in this order:

1. Use `PSST_CONFIG` if it is set.
2. Look for `psst.json` or `.psst.json` in the following locations:
   - Current directory
   - Parent directories (up to and including the home directory)
3. If no configuration file is found, use `.psst.json` in the current directory.

If the file does not exist, it will be created when the first secret is added via the console.

Example config:

```json
{
  "API_KEY": {
    "source": "op",
    "value": "op://vault/item/field"
  }
}
```
